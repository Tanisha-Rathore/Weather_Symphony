🎵☀️ Weather-Based Music Recommendation App 🌧️🎶

Excited to share a recent project I built using Java Spring Boot! 🚀

🔍 What it does:
This web app recommends music based on the current weather of any city you enter. Using real-time weather data from an API, it suggests music genres that match the mood—sunny days get upbeat pop, rainy days lean toward blues or ambient, and so on.

🔧 Tech Stack:

Spring Boot (MVC, REST)

HTTPClient for API integration

JSON parsing (weather data)

Dynamic genre-track mapping logic

💡 A fun way to blend APIs, Java backend, and a touch of creativity!

Check it out, and let me know what you think! Would love your feedback. 😊
